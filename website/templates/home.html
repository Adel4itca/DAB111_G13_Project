    <h2>Welcome to the DAB111 Group13 Project</h2>

    <p>
        This web application was developed as part of the DAB111 course to demonstrate 
        the complete data workflow from raw data to a fully functional Flask-based system. 
        The project integrates <strong>data collection</strong>, <strong>data cleaning</strong>, 
        <strong>database management</strong>, and <strong>web development</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using this system, you can perform the following tasks:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>View summary information about the dataset</li>
        <li>Display all book records stored in the SQLite database</li>
        <li>Upload CSV files and automatically insert them into the database</li>
        <li>Add new book records manually</li>
        <li>Delete book records using BookID</li>
        <li>Analyze category distribution through histograms</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This platform provides a hands-on experience combining 
        Python programming, SQL queries, Flask development, and data visualization.
